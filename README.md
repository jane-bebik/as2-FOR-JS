How it works

	app.js:  This is the main file that starts everything.

	utilities.js: This file is like a toolbox; it has various tools (functions) that app.js uses.

  
	utilities.js

First function: Merges a first name and a last name into a welcoming message

Second function: turns a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Third function: Calculates how many ways you can arrange a number of items.

Forth function: This function retrieves the current date and prints the day of the week in a human-readable format. Like today is monday!
